Be it the employees, faculty, and staff attendance or daily attendance of students, on an average 20-30 minutes gets wasted, which otherwise could be reserved for fruitful teaching-learning or other academics-related activities. Also, data entry errors are common when attendance is marked, generating attendance reports manually is difficult, and student data safety remains a point of concern."
